## Reflection

**Who was the client, and what were their software requirements?**  
The client was The Gaming Room, and they wanted to expand their Android game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a scalable, web-based application. The software needed to support multiple teams, unique names for all entities, and be deployable across different platforms.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**  
I clearly explained the system architecture and how design patterns like Singleton and Iterator would be used. The organization of the document made it easy to understand how the system would function.

**What did you find helpful about working through the design document?**  
It helped me plan out how the application would work before jumping into code. Thinking through requirements, constraints, and architecture made everything more manageable during implementation.

**If you could revise one part, what would it be and how would you improve it?**  
I would improve the visual layout of the domain model and add more detailed mockups or flow diagrams to help visualize user interaction better.

**How did you interpret and implement the user’s needs in your design?**  
I translated the client's goals into specific design requirements—like using a Singleton pattern to manage the game engine and enforcing name uniqueness across all entities. This ensured the final design aligned closely with their expectations.

**Why is considering the user's needs so important when designing software?**  
Because if the software doesn’t meet user needs, it won’t succeed—even if it’s built well technically. Users should be the center of the design process.

**What strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design software?**  
I would continue using structured design documents, clearly separating responsibilities using design patterns, and involving user feedback earlier in the planning phase.
